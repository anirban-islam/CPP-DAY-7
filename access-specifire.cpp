//In C++, there are three access specifiers:

//public - members are accessible from outside the class
//private - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class
//protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes.

 // public:    // Public access specifier
  //  int x;   // Public attribute
 // private:   // Private access specifier
   // int y;   // Private attribute
